# Introduction

Hi, I’ve been working on projects for over 5 years, and during this time, I built a tool called lint-commit to make my workflow more efficient. After using it for about a year, I realized it saved me an incredible amount of time by automating commit message creation, especially when working on larger projects with multiple team members.

While `lint-commit` was effective, I wanted to do even more. I took the learnings from that tool and rebuilt it from the ground up as `git-mind`. This new tool is designed to generate intelligent, AI-powered git commit messages, ensuring that commit messages are not only helpful for teams and code reviews but also help projects stand out by avoiding poorly written, amateurish messages.

`git-mind` is currently in beta. While there won’t be any breaking changes during this stage, it is open to community contributions and feature suggestions. Some key design decisions include:

- If the number of files to be staged exceeds `5`, git-mind consolidates all changes into a single commit to save resources.
- git-mind doesn’t cover every possible use case, which is why the `git-mind ask <question>` command exists. This command prompts AI models to provide git-related responses exclusively. If the query isn’t git-related, the tool will respond with "Unable to process that."

I’m excited to share git-mind and look forward to seeing how it can help developers worldwide streamline their workflows.
