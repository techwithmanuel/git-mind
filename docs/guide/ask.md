# Ask

The git-mind ask command allows you to query AI models for git-related questions. Follow the guidelines below for the best experience.

## Usage

```bash
# Locally installed
git-mind ask "<your-question>"

# with npx
npx git-mind@latest ask "<your-question>"
```

## Guidelines

1. **Keep it Git-Related**: Ensure your questions are strictly about git commands or workflows. Examples include:

- "How do I create a new branch?"

- "What is the difference between merge and rebase?"

- "How do I resolve merge conflicts?"

2. **Be Specific**: Provide as much context as possible to get accurate and helpful responses.

3. **AI Model Responses**: The AI models are prompted to provide git-specific answers. If a question isnâ€™t git-related, the response will be:

- "Unable to process that."

4. **Example Questions**

- "How do I squash commits?"

- "What is a detached HEAD state?"

- "How can I check the status of my remote repository?"

Feel free to experiment and make the most of this versatile command!
